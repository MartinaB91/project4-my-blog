# Test and validations
## Introduction 
During the development process, unit testing has been done to check if functionality is as expected. Same test has been executed again later on when new features has been added.

Test results [here](/testing/TEST_RECORDS.md)

### Responsiveness tests

Responsivness has been tested with help of [Responsivepx](https://www.responsivepx.com/) and [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). Following device sizes/breakpoints has been tested:

Devtools has been used for testing devices from small phone(<360px) to large tablet (1024px). Responsivepx has been used more exploratory, by increasing and decreasing width and height to various sizes. 

Tests has also been conducted on the following physical devices:
- Samsung s10
- Samsung s20
- Samsung s20 Ultra 
- Asus 17" Laptop
- External screen 22"

### Exploratory tests 

Exploratory test has been done to try to find behaviour not covered in automatic testing and functional testing. Focus has be on those areas that often are used and were errors can do a lot of harm. I have also tried to use the app "wrong" to see what happens.

Test results[here](/testing/TEST_RECORDS.md)

### Usability testing

In this test three independent users has been presented with some tasks to do in the blog portal. Through testing the person has been observed to see if any usability improvements can be found. The main focus on these tests is to see if the site is easy to navigate and operative. Which is important to get recurrent users. Before the test start the test user will be informed that this is not a test of how well they preform the tasks but a way to find improvements on the site. 

The user was tasked to perform the following:
1.	Create a account.
2.  Find all posts in category "Dahlias"
3.	Create a blog post
4.  Find the page were you can see all your blog posts
5.	Update the blog post you created
6.  Leave a comment on a blog post
7.  Like a blog post
8.  Sign out from your account



### Automatic tests

### Lighthouse reports

Since the purpose of the blog app is to showcase nice pictures, the performance is lower. During the validation process i manage to improve this significantly, when starting the video header was three times the size and images were already compressed but now are compressed in Webp-format. No more steps will be taken to improve this since this will go against the purpose of the site. 

If there was more time to develop the site a first step would be to prevent users uploading to large images and in bad formats. A more user-friendly approach would be to include a third party tool to convert and compress pictures.  

Since the above mentioned is not fixed or implemented itâ€™s up to the administrator to not approve posts with to larges pictures uploaded. Not doing so will result in bad performance.
